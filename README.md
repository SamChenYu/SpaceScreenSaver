Pixel Plants Orbiting the Sun, each planet has their own orbit speed.
Currently has Earth, Mars and Venus.
Saturn and Mercury are also available just that their code is all commented - it tends to get very cluttered.
The planets follow the elliptical function :
y = 800^2 -(x-(screenWidth/2))^2*(xStretchFactor)
